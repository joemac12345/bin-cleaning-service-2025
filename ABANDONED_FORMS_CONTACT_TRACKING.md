## 🔧 How It Works

### Email Open Tracking
1. When you send an email, a unique tracking ID is generated: `{formId}-{timestamp}`
2. A 1x1 transparent pixel image is embedded in email HTML: 
   ```html
   <img src="https://your-site.com/api/track-email-open?id={trackingId}" width="1" height="1" />
   ```
3. When customer opens email in their email client, the pixel loads
4. API receives request, marks email as opened, updates status
5. Admin sees "Opened" badge with eye icon 👁️

### Manual Workflow
1. **View abandoned forms** → Filter by "Never Contacted"
2. **Click on a form** → Opens detail modal
3. **Choose action**:
   - **Send Email** → Select template → Confirm send
   - **Log Phone Call** → Select outcome → Add notes → Save
4. **Track progress** → Contact history shows all attempts
5. **Filter by status** → Focus on forms that need follow-up

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Email Follow-up
```
1. Customer abandons form with email
2. Status: never_contacted (Red dot)
3. Admin clicks "Send Email" → Selects "Abandoned Booking Recovery"
4. Email sent → Status: email_sent (Blue dot)
5. Customer opens email → Status: responded (Yellow dot)
6. Admin sees "Opened" badge in contact history
```

### Scenario 2: Phone Follow-up
```
1. Customer abandons form with phone number
2. Admin clicks "Log Phone Call"
3. Selects outcome: "Answered - Interested"
4. Adds note: "Wants service next Tuesday"
5. Status changes to: responded (Yellow dot)
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Attempts
```
1. Send email → Status: email_sent
2. No open after 2 days
3. Log phone call → "No Answer"
4. Status changes to: multiple_attempts (Orange dot)
5. Try again later, track all attempts in history
```
