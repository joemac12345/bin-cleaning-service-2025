# Alternative Static Deployment Guide

If you're having trouble with the Netlify Next.js plugin, here's a simpler static deployment approach:

## Option 1: Static Export (Most Reliable)

1. **Update Next.js config for static export:**
   ```bash
   # This will create a static version without server functions
   npm run export-static
   ```

2. **Deploy the static files:**
   - Upload the `out` folder to any static hosting
   - Works with Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.

## Option 2: Alternative Hosting Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy (easiest)
vercel
```

### Railway.app
1. Go to railway.app
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Automatic deployment with zero config

### Render.com
1. Go to render.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Choose "Static Site" option
