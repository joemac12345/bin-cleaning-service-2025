```

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select your site
3. Settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Environment
4. Add new environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase key
   - `GMAIL_USER` = your-email@gmail.com
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASS` = your 16-character app password

## Testing Gmail SMTP

### Option 1: Use Admin Deployment Page
1. Go to `/admin/deployment`
2. Enter Gmail credentials
3. Click "Test Gmail SMTP"
4. Check that test email arrives

### Option 2: Manual API Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"testEmail":"your-email@gmail.com"}'
```

### Option 3: Send Email from Booking Manager

2. Click "Send Email" on a booking
3. Select template and click "Send"
4. Check customer email for receipt

---

## Gmail App Password Setup (If Needed)

If you need to generate a new Gmail App Password:

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication (if not already enabled)
3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Select "Mail" and "Windows (or other device)"
5. Google generates a 16-character password
6. Copy and use as `GMAIL_APP_PASS` (remove spaces)

**Important:** Use the App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password

---

## What If Emails Still Don't Send?

### Check 1: Verify Gmail Configuration
```bash
# In your server console when app starts, you should see:
‚úÖ Gmail SMTP service configured
```

If you see:
```
‚ùå Gmail not configured - please set GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_APP_PASS
```

Then your environment variables aren't set correctly.

### Check 2: Test Email Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-email
```

Should return success with no errors.

### Check 3: Check Server Logs
When sending an email, server logs should show:
```
üìß Sending templated email for booking: BK-xxx
üìã Found booking: {...}
üë§ Customer info extracted: {email: 'customer@example.com', ...}
‚úÖ Gmail email sent successfully: <message-id>
```

### Check 4: Check Browser Console
Network tab should show successful POST to `/api/send-email` with response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "messageId": "...",
  "service": "gmail"
}
```

### Check 5: Verify Customer Email
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Check if email was delivered (might take a minute)
3. Verify correct email address on booking
