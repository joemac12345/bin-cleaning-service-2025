- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Content suggestions**:
  - Show a clean wheelie bin (before/after if possible)
  - Add your business name/logo
  - Include text: "Professional Bin Cleaning Service"
  - Use bright, clean colors
  - Keep important content in the center (safe zone)

**Free Design Tools:**
- Canva (easiest - has templates for "Facebook Link")
- Figma (more professional)
- Photoshop/GIMP (if you have design skills)

### 2. Update Your Domain

In `/src/app/layout.tsx`, replace:
```typescript
url: "https://yourdomain.com"
```

With your actual domain (once you have it).
